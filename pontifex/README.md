# Pontifex

Pontifex implements the Solitaire encryption algorithm, as described in the appendix of the book Cryptonomicon by Neal Stephenson. Solitaire is a cypher that can be performed using a deck of playing cards. If two people each have a deck of playing cards in the same order, each can generate a keystream that can be used to encypher and decypher a message.
