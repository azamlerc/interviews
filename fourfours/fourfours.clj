;; Four fours is a mathematical puzzle. The goal is to find a mathematical expression for every whole number from 1 to 100, using only common mathematical symbols and the number four four times.

;; Problem: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_fours
;; Playground: https://andrewzc.net/fourfours/

;; In this case, we will start with the initial values 4, .4, âˆš4 and 4! and combine them using the operations addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.

(defn round [d] (Double/parseDouble (format "%.6f" d)))

(defn combine [fa fb]
  (->> (for [a fa b fb] 
    [(+ a b) (- a b) (- b a) (* a b)
      (if (zero? b) [] (round (/ a b)))
      (if (zero? a) [] (round (/ b a)))])
  (flatten)
  (distinct)
  (sort)))
