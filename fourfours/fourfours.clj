;; Four fours is a mathematical puzzle. The goal is to find a mathematical expression for every whole number from 1 to 100, using only common mathematical symbols and the number four four times.

;; Problem: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_fours
;; Playground: https://andrewzc.net/fourfours/

;; In this case, we will start with the initial values 4, .4, âˆš4 and 4! and combine them using the operations addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.
