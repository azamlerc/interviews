# Subway Distance

Write a program to calculate the time that it would take to commute from an apartment to the Compass office using the New York City Subway. You can walk to a station, take a train to another station, and from there walk to the office. You cannot transfer between trains.

Take a section of the Manhattan street grid bounded by Ave A to 11 Av, and Houston St to 59 St. We can express coordinates as (blocks west of Ave A, blocks north of Houston). For example, the coordinates for the Compass office are (5,14) because it is at the intersection of 5 Av and 14 St. 

Extension: Allow transferring between two lines.
